/**
 * Implementation of the SASL EXTERNAL mechanism.
 *
 * To effectively use this mechanism, Java must be configured to properly 
 * supply a client SSL certificate (of some sort) to the server. It is up
 * to the implementer to determine how to do this.  Here is one method:
 *
 * Create a java keystore with your SSL certificate in it:
 * keytool -genkey -alias username -dname "cn=username,ou=organizationalUnit,o=organizationaName,l=locality,s=state,c=country"
 *
 * Next, set the System Properties:
 *  <ul>
 *  <li>javax.net.ssl.keyStore to the location of the keyStore
 *  <li>javax.net.ssl.keyStorePassword to the password of the keyStore
 *  <li>javax.net.ssl.trustStore to the location of the trustStore
 *  <li>javax.net.ssl.trustStorePassword to the the password of the trustStore
 *  </ul>
 *
 * Then, when the server requests or requires the client certificate, java will
 * simply provide the one in the keyStore.
 *
 * Also worth noting is the EXTERNAL mechanism in Smack is not enabled by default.
 * To enable it, the implementer will need to call SASLAuthentication.supportSASLMechamism("EXTERNAL");
